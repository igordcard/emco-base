EMCO Contributors
=================
The Contributors list is split between two sections: Committers and All Contributors.
For additional information or clarifications, please refer to the [EMCO Governance](https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/display/EMCO/Governance).

Committers
----------
Committers are individuals with voting rights to approve or reject particular code contributions, within the limits specified by EMCO's governance.
Although the committer list is unified (i.e. for all repositories under EMCO), each member is usually responsible for a certain repository and/or area.
As such, the list below also specifies which repository or area the committer is primarily responsible for.
Consistent with EMCO's governance, newer committers may be added or removed over time.
This list is sorted by the First Name.
